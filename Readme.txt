Hi Folks!!

	U might have downloaded this cooooooolllllll code from www.planetwourcecode.com. Not much time i took to giv ya another code. I feel, this small code will help to let ya know, how to make a command button animated at runtime. Please follow these instructions carefully.


1. Using a Animated GIF
	
	. Make sure that u extract frames of your GIF with any easily GIF 		  Frame extractors, available easily ( go through search engines ). 

	. Go through the code written for the Timer control carefully.This is 	  the core of the application. There you will understand, how to call 	  those bitmap's, for a given interval of time.

2. Using Other Images Files ( Not Animated )
	
	. Follow Step 2 of point 1.


Note: I authorise you to distribute this code free to anybody, but on one condition. Don ever say that u programmed it. Do rate my code at www.planetsourcecode.com or sureshramanujam@rediffmail.com
